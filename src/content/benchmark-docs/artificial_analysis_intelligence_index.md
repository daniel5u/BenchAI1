## Overview

The Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v4.0 is a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates AI models across 10 diverse and challenging evaluations. It represents a holistic assessment of artificial intelligence capabilities, covering reasoning, knowledge, coding, instruction following, and scientific understanding.

## Component Evaluations

This intelligence index aggregates performance from the following benchmarks:

| Category | Benchmark | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Reasoning** | 𝜏²-Bench Telecom | Dual-control conversational AI benchmark for technical support scenarios |
| **Agent** | Terminal-Bench Hard | AI capabilities in terminal environments |
| **Coding** | SciCode | Scientist-curated coding problems from laboratory settings |
| **Reasoning** | AA-LCR | Long Context Reasoning benchmark |
| **Knowledge** | AA-Omniscience | General knowledge assessment |
| **Instruction-Following** | IFBench | Precise instruction-following generalization |
| **Academic** | Humanity's Last Exam | Multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge |
| **Scientific** | GPQA Diamond | Graduate-level scientific Q&A |
| **Agent** | CritPt | Critical thinking and problem-solving |
| **General** | GDPval-AA | General domain performance validation |

## Purpose

This composite index provides a comprehensive view of an AI model's intelligence by evaluating performance across multiple dimensions. It helps identify well-rounded models that excel in diverse challenges rather than specializing in narrow domains.
