## Overview

MMLU-Pro, developed by the TIGER AI Lab, represents a significant enhancement to the original MMLU benchmark. It increases difficulty, expands coverage, and introduces more challenging questions designed to better differentiate between AI models.

## Key Improvements Over Original MMLU

| Feature | MMLU (Original) | MMLU-Pro |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Total Questions** | ~10,000 | 12,000+ |
| **Answer Options** | 4 | 10 |
| **Difficulty Level** | Undergraduate | Graduate-level |
| **Reasoning Depth** | Moderate | Deeper required |

## Subject Coverage

MMLU-Pro covers **14 major academic subject areas**:

| Category | Subjects |
|----------|----------|
| **STEM** | Physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics |
| **Humanities** | History, philosophy, law |
| **Social Sciences** | Psychology, sociology, economics |
| **Professional** | Medicine, engineering, computer science |
| **Other** | Business, ethics, political science |

## Why Graduate-Level?

Graduate-level questions in MMLU-Pro require:

- Deeper understanding of fundamental concepts
- Integration of knowledge across multiple domains
- Critical thinking and analysis
- Application of theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios
- Nuanced understanding rather than surface-level recall

## Answer Format

With **10 answer options** (compared to 4 in original MMLU), guessing becomes much more difficult, making the benchmark more reliable for measuring true knowledge.

## Purpose

MMLU-Pro provides a rigorous test of AI models' academic capabilities, specifically designed to:

- Challenge even the most capable AI systems
- Better differentiate between model capabilities
- Reflect real-world graduate-level expertise requirements
- Provide stable, reproducible evaluation metrics
