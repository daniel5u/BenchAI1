## Overview

GPQA (Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A) Diamond is an advanced scientific question-answering benchmark designed to test AI models on graduate-level academic questions. The "Diamond" designation indicates it represents the most challenging subset of the GPQA dataset.

## Key Characteristics

- **Difficulty Level**: Graduate-level scientific questions
- **Domain Coverage**: Physics, chemistry, biology, and other scientific disciplines
- **Quality Control**: Questions verified by domain experts to ensure accuracy and difficulty
- **Anti-Prompting**: Designed to be resistant to simple retrieval-based approaches

## Comparison to MMLU

While MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) covers a broad range of undergraduate-level topics, GPQA Diamond focuses specifically on:

- More advanced and specialized scientific content
- Deeper reasoning requirements
- Questions that require genuine expertise rather than general knowledge
- Problems that are challenging even for highly educated humans

## Purpose

GPQA Diamond assesses whether AI models can demonstrate true scientific understanding at a graduate level, rather than simply memorizing information or using surface-level pattern matching.
