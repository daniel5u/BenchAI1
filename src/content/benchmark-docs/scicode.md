## Overview

SciCode represents a unique approach to evaluating code-generating AI models - one that bridges the gap between general programming and scientific research. Developed by domain scientists, this benchmark uses real laboratory problems that researchers actually encounter in their work.

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Sub-tasks** | 338 |
| **Source Problems** | 80 genuine lab problems |
| **Scientific Disciplines** | 16 different fields |
| **Evaluation Focus** | Code + Scientific accuracy |

## Discipline Coverage

SciCode spans **16 scientific disciplines**, including:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Life Sciences** | Molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry |
| **Physical Sciences** | Physics, chemistry, materials science |
| **Earth Sciences** | Geology, climate science, ecology |
| **Computational Sciences** | Bioinformatics, computational chemistry |

## What Makes SciCode Unique

1. **Authenticity**: Problems come from actual research scenarios
2. **Domain Expertise**: Curated by practicing scientists
3. **Multi-step Tasks**: Requires understanding context before coding
4. **Scientific Validation**: Code must produce scientifically accurate results

## Evaluation Criteria

SciCode doesn't just test whether code runs - it tests whether code produces **correct scientific outcomes**:

- **Functional Correctness**: Does the code execute without errors?
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Do results match expected scientific outcomes?
- **Methodological Soundness**: Does the approach follow scientific best practices?
- **Reproducibility**: Can results be replicated?

## Example Task Types

- Data analysis pipelines for experimental results
- Statistical analysis of scientific datasets
- Simulation code for physical/biological phenomena
- Data visualization for research publications
- Image processing for scientific imaging

## Purpose

SciCode evaluates whether AI models can be useful assistants in scientific research - generating code that actually works for real scientific challenges rather than just algorithmic exercises.
