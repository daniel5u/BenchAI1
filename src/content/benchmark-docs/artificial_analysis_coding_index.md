## Overview

The Artificial Analysis Coding Index is a composite benchmark that aggregates performance across multiple coding-focused evaluations. It provides a unified view of how well AI models perform on programming-related tasks by combining results from several established coding benchmarks.

## Component Benchmarks

This index incorporates performance metrics from:

- **Terminal-Bench Hard**: Evaluates AI capabilities in terminal environments through software engineering, system administration, and data processing tasks
- **SciCode**: A scientist-curated coding benchmark featuring sub-tasks derived from genuine laboratory problems across scientific disciplines

## Purpose

By averaging performance across multiple coding benchmarks, this index provides a more comprehensive assessment of a model's overall coding ability. It helps identify models that excel across different programming scenarios rather than being specialists in just one type of coding task.
