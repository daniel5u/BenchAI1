## Overview

τ-bench (Tau-bench), developed by Sierra, evaluates AI agents in collaborative scenarios that mirror complex enterprise environments. Unlike benchmarks focused on single tasks, τ-bench tests multi-step coordination and planning.

## Core Challenge

The benchmark presents AI agents with scenarios requiring:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Coordination** | Working with users to achieve goals |
| **Guidance** | Providing clear directions and explanations |
| **Adaptation** | Adjusting strategies based on user feedback |
| **Complex Planning** | Managing multi-step workflows |

## Scenario Types

τ-bench covers diverse enterprise scenarios:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Customer Service** | Technical support, complaint resolution |
| **Project Management** | Task coordination, timeline management |
| **Consulting** | Advising on business or technical decisions |
| **Operations** | Coordinating resources and workflows |

## What Makes τ-bench Unique

1. **Multi-turn Interactions**: Requires maintaining conversation context
2. **User Simulation**: Test users with varying expertise levels
3. **Goal-oriented**: Success measured by objective completion
4. **Enterprise Complexity**: Realistic business scenarios

## Evaluation Dimensions

Models are assessed on:

- **Goal Achievement**: Did the agent help the user succeed?
- **Communication Quality**: Clarity and helpfulness of guidance
- **Efficiency**: Number of interactions needed
- **Adaptability**: Handling user mistakes and confusion
- **Professionalism**: Appropriate tone and expertise demonstration

## Example Scenarios

- "Help me plan and execute a product launch"
- "Guide me through setting up a new development environment"
- "Assist with resolving a complex customer complaint"
- "Coordinate a team migration to a new toolchain"

## Purpose

τ-bench evaluates whether AI agents can function as **collaborative partners** in enterprise settings - not just as question-answering tools but as proactive assistants capable of guiding complex work.
