## Overview

LiveCodeBench, developed by researchers at UC Berkeley, MIT, and Cornell University, represents a dynamic approach to evaluating code-generation AI models. Unlike static benchmarks, LiveCodeBench continuously updates with new problems from real-world programming competitions.

## Data Sources

The benchmark draws from three major competitive programming platforms:

| Platform | Description | Problem Types |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **LeetCode** | Popular platform for interview prep and algorithm practice | Data structures, algorithms, optimization |
| **AtCoder** | Japanese competitive programming platform | Algorithm challenges, contests |
| **Codeforces** | Largest competitive programming community | Diverse algorithmic problems |

## Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dynamic Updates** | Problems added as competitions occur |
| **Real-world Testing** | Problems from actual contests, not synthetic examples |
| **Comprehensive Coverage** | Multiple difficulty levels and topics |
| **Holistic Evaluation** | Tests various code-related scenarios |

## What Makes LiveCodeBench Valuable

1. **Currency**: Always reflects current programming challenges
2. **Difficulty Progression**: Problems range from easy to extremely difficult
3. **Diverse Problem Types**: Covers algorithms, data structures, optimization, and more
4. **Automated Evaluation**: Test cases verify correctness automatically

## Evaluation Metrics

Models are typically evaluated on:

- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of problems solved
- **Execution Time**: How efficiently the generated code runs
- **Code Quality**: Readability, style, and efficiency
- **Problem Understanding**: Ability to correctly interpret problem statements

## Purpose

LiveCodeBench provides ongoing, standardized evaluation of Code LLMs, ensuring that model comparisons remain relevant as programming challenges evolve.
